# lottery_app

The Lottery App is a simple Flutter application that allows users to generate a random number and test their luck. This documentation provides an overview of the code structure and functionality.

The main purpose of the app is to provide users with a random lucky number and display an appropriate message based on the generated number. The app consists of two screens: the main screen displaying the welcome message and the lucky number, and a secondary screen showing a success message if the generated number matches a predefined value.
